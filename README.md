# Semtimental_Analysis-

1. Business Understanding¶
The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The IMDB dataset, which has 50,000 labeled reviews, is a good starting point for training and testing such a model. By using natural language processing (NLP), the model will learn patterns in the text that show whether a review expresses positive or negative feelings.

From a business point of view, sentiment analysis is very useful. Movie companies, streaming platforms, and review websites can use it to understand audience reactions at scale. Instead of reading thousands of reviews manually, they can quickly measure overall sentiment, track customer feedback trends, and improve their strategies. Outside the movie industry, this type of analysis is also useful for monitoring customer experience, analyzing product reviews, and managing brand reputation in many different fields.

Another important use is in recommendation systems. Adding sentiment analysis can make recommendations more personal. For example, platforms can use both ratings and written reviews to better understand what users like or dislike. This leads to more accurate recommendations and higher user satisfaction. Companies can also use this approach to monitor reviews in real time, find negative feedback early, and fix problems faster.

To make sure the model works well, a few key questions need to be asked:

Can the model reliably separate positive and negative reviews?
Which evaluation measures are best for this task? While accuracy is simple to use, it may not always give the full picture. Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC help to better understand the model’s true performance.
Does the model generalize well to new reviews, and can it avoid overfitting on the training data?
In short, the business understanding phase highlights the goal, usefulness, and evaluation criteria of the project. It makes sure that the technical work is aligned with real-world needs and that the final solution is both reliable and valuable.
